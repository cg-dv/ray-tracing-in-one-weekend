# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

Implementation of a ray tracer written while working through the book ["Ray 
Tracing in One Weekend"](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8) by Dr. Peter Shirley.

This is a fairly simple ray tracer.  The end result includes simple diffuse/matte 
objects, as well as surfaces with the reflective properties of metals or 
glass.
